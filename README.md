# First steps with UNIX course

Welcome to the home page of the **First steps with UNIX** SIB course.

<br>

### Course material

* [Course slides](first_steps_with_UNIX.pdf)
* [Exercise instructions](exercise_instructions.md)
* [Exercise material](exercises.zip)

### Setting-up your environment

Please make sure to read this and setup your environment
**before the start of the course**.

The only technical requirement for the course is having a laptop with a
reasonably recent version of either a `bash` shell (version >= `4.0`), or a
`zsh` shell (the default shell on Mac OS since 2019).

* **Linux and Mac OS**: the above requirements should in principle already
  be met, and there should be no need to install anything.
* **Windows**: please see the
  [setting-up your environment instructions](environment_setup.md) for
  instructions on how to install a `bash` shell on your machine.

## Course description

### Overview

With the constant evolution of technologies, life scientists such as laboratory
**biologists** are faced with an increasing need for **bioinformatics skills**
to deal with high-throughput data storage, retrieval and analysis.

Although several resources developed for such tasks have a graphical user
interface, many operations can be more efficiently handled with
**command-line** programs and utilities.

This course is an introduction to using computers in **command line** via a
**terminal**, and more specifically the
**[Bash shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)** as well as some of the
core UNIX commands.

### Audience

This course is addressed to **beginners** wanting to become familiar with the
UNIX environment and master the most common commands, which could be useful to
run software dedicated to high-throughput data management.

### Learning objectives

At the end of the course you should:

* Be able to execute most basic UNIX commands
* Be able to build complex and combined commands using various parameters
* Be sufficiently skilled for further courses requiring basics of UNIX, like
  HPC or NGS courses

An optional exam can be taken at the end of the course to get a recommendation
for 0.25 ECTS credits.
