* [Exam instructions](exam_instructions.md)

### Environment setup

The only technical requirement for the course is having a laptop with a
reasonably recent version of either a `bash` shell (version >= `4.0`), or a
`zsh` shell (the default shell on Mac OS since 2019).
You can display your version of `bash` with the command `bash --version`.

## Course description

### Overview :owl:

With the constant evolution of technologies, life scientists such as laboratory
**biologists** are faced with an increasing need for **bioinformatics skills**
to deal with high-throughput data storage, retrieval and analysis.

Although several resources developed for such tasks have a graphical user
interface, many operations can be more efficiently handled with
**command-line** programs and utilities.

This course is an introduction to using computers in **command line** via a
**terminal**, and more specifically the
**[Bash shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)** as well as some of the
core Linux / UNIX commands.

### Audience :mega:

This course is addressed to **beginners** wanting to become familiar with the
Linux / UNIX environment, its basic commands, and the Bash shell.

### Learning objectives :dart:

At the end of the course you should:

* Be able to execute most of the basic Linux / UNIX commands.
* Be able to build complex and combined commands using various parameters
* Be sufficiently skilled for further courses requiring basics of Linux / UNIX,
  like HPC or NGS courses.

An optional exam can be taken at the end of the course to get a recommendation
for 0.25 ECTS credits.
